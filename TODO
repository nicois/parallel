* find a way to easily map the command (and input) to the output.
use cases:
- view the output for a specific command/input
- search all outputs for a certain type of command/input (eg: which failure outputs of command X include the string Y?)


complications:
- can't store the command/input in a filename, unless it's OK to be lossy
- not great to store in the same file as the output, as searching output may match on the command by accident

options:
- create a lossy symlink alongside the hash with the output.
- put the command/input in the file, as the first line
- create a sqlite database (or plain file) mapping command/input to hash

current idea:
- create a subdirectory named with the job hash, and a single file inside with a sanitised version
  of the command+input. The MTIME of this file is used to determine when it last succeeded/failed

* use sqlite to store (most of) the btree when defering retries, to avoid unbounded memory usage.
can't use bigset as its structure is not designed for sorting. Make something similar which allows inserts and popping of the minimum value.
Could retain a limited number of items in memory for optimisation purposes, but it shouldn't be necessary; the additional time taken to
retrieve the next item to run will be negligible compared to the jobs' execution times. Additionally, the channel will usually have one job
waiting for collection anyway, so there will only be any delay when there is a burst of new jobs being created
