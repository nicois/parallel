find a way to easily map the command (and input) to the output.
use cases:
- view the output for a specific command/input
- search all outputs for a certain type of command/input (eg: which failure outputs of command X include the string Y?)


complications:
- can't store the command/input in a filename, unless it's OK to be lossy
- not great to store in the same file as the output, as searching output may match on the command by accident

options:
- create a lossy symlink alongside the hash with the output.
- put the command/input in the file, as the first line
- create a sqlite database (or plain file) mapping command/input to hash

current plan:
- create a subdirectory named with the job hash, and a single file inside with a sanitised version
  of the command+input. The MTIME of this file is used to determine when it last succeeded/failed
